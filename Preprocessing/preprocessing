## This is the Preprocessing Phase

In this work, the most important steps were the preprocessing level. 
<br>Five different scenarios have been designed to evaluate different preprocessing techniques and check them with using two different architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks.
<br>At first, images have been read. Afterwards, class weight technique and rotation augmentation have been applied in order to make our classes balanced. 
In the last two scenarios image, contrast enhancement with rotation augmentation and class weight technique have been combined.

<br><br>The codes of all phases can be found in this folder.
